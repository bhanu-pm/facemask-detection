## Installation

Download and Install python from the official website.
Go to cmd or any other terminal and run the commands below.

```bash
  py -m pip install --user virtualenv
  py -m venv FacemaskDetection
  FacemaskDetection\scripts\activate
```
Then open the FacemaskDetection directory(in the same terminal) 
cloned from Github, then run the command below.

```bash
  py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deployment
